# DotProgress

DotProgress is a simple and somewhat hypnotic progress indicator. It's customizable, and has no dependencies. [Demos.](https://jiggmin.com/projects/dot-progress/examples.html)

## Simple Example

	//create a DotProgress instance
	var elm = document.getElementById('dot-holder');
  var dots = new dotProgress.DotProgress(elm);

  //set progress as things load
  dots.setProgress(.5);

## Using images

	//javascript
	var options = {
		activeDisplay: '',
		inactiveDisplay: '',
	};
	var elm = document.getElementById('dot-holder');
	var dots = new dotProgress.DotProgress(elm, options);
	dots.setProgress(.5);

	//css
	.dot-inactive {
  	background: url('/img/dot-sprite.png');
  	width: 12px;
  	height: 12px;
  }

  .dot-active {
  	background: url('/img/dot-sprite.png') -12px 0px;
  	width: 12px;
  	height: 12px;
  }

**zRotVel (Number) (Default=0)**
